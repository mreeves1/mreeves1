# Projects

Some projects I want to do/ am doing:
  - Homelab kubernetes cluster with a few Raspberry Pis provisioned and orchestrated with some or all of the following:
    - Ansible
    - [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/)
    - [Rancher](https://www.rancher.com/)
    - ???
  - [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) based static markdown file based blog on various geeky and personal topics served by the 
    [Digital Ocean App Platform](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/).  
    See [Current POC placeholder at runthing.com](https://runthing.com/)
  - Bring [GrandPrix.run](https://grandprix.run/) back from the :skull_and_crossbones: and get a [POC working](https://github.com/mreeves1/grandprix.run) 
    to rebuld my fullstack web dev ðŸ’ª
  - Create a few IAC repos to practice my terraform and [Cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) and possibly learn [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) and [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html)
    and have a bit of proof I know what I am doing.  
    In particular I want to easily bring up a vpc + eks cluster with managed nodes to play around with in AWS.
  - Create TF to create and manage a kubernetes cluster in Digital Ocean and migrate a few tiny projects to k8s vs. VMs there.
