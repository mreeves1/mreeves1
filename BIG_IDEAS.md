## Running Club Website

My brilliant startup idea is a running (and perhaps later cycling) club website.  
  I have been in running clubs for many years and their websites are always cobbled together with wix, squarespace, meetup, instagram, 
  facebook groups, mailing lists, paypal, venmo, spit, baling wire, duct tape, etc.  
  I'd like it to have the following features:
  - Membership and dues management
  - Event management
  - Merge my grandprix.run POC above
  - Possibly a way to find running partners, etc. within a club
  - Mailing list and Socials management (e.g. add an event and send an emal, insta post, facebook group post, etc.)
  - Possibly a way to share and display photos
  - A rudmentary forum?
  - A way to share good commercial resources like doctors, running stores, physical therapists, etc? 

## App to Help People w/ Memory Problems

Essentially a general purpose app to help remind people (often seniors) with memory problems to do certain activities such as fill their pill-boxes, take their medication, pay their bills, go to appointments, etc. Might need a custodian/client model. I have a family member who is the inspiration for this app and general purpose alarms and calendars don't work well.
