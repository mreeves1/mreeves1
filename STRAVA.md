# Strava Year in Review

[My Strava profile](https://www.strava.com/athletes/4131127). 

I am mostly a runner but came to love cycling when I started doing spin class due to a running injury (which eventually went away after enough rest and cycling occurred). I also rode with a fun group of recreational riders that met through the defunct Performance Bicycle in Mountain View, CA and did a few tours on my late 90s Cannondale F400 Mountain Bike (with slicks). I met a friend named Mark at the spin class and I took my recently purchased road bike on a variety of hilly rides with him such as Pagemill Road in Palo Alto, Kings Mountain in Woodside as well as Alpine Road, Old La Honda and Tunitas Creek in the vicinity. I ended up doing a handful of metric and full centuries that usually had about 100 ft. of climb per mile. My single biggest day was 135 miles with around 13,500 ft. of climbing at the [Santa Cruz Mountains Challenge](https://santacruzmountainschallenge.com/). I love the Redwoods! 

I get a kick out of reflecting on the past year of running and cycling in Strava.
