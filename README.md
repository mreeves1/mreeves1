:wave: Hi, Iâ€™m Mike Reeves, a former Mechanical Engineer, turned full stack web dev finally landing on the DevOps/SRE/Platform Engineer specialty.  
I :heart: IAC (Infrastructure as Code), the :cloud:(aka other peoples' computers) and the full stack from Linux :arrow_right: CDNs and all the interesting stuff in between. 

:telescope: Iâ€™m searching for a new position as a DevOps Architect / Principal / Staff / Lead / Manager (if w/ a heavy IC aspect).   
See my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/runamok/) and my [pc-mreeves Github account](https://github.com/pc-mreeves) 
which reflects some of my contributions at [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com/company) which I left after 6 years and several promotions.  

- :eyes: Iâ€™m interested in:
  - [Ansible]([https://aws.amazon.com/](https://www.ansible.com/))
  - [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
  - Cooking
  - Cycling
  - [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) and IAC (Infrastructure as Code)
  - Hacking & Making
  - Observability
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/) (as well as Bash, Ruby and PHP)
  - Reading
  - Running
  - Snowboarding
  - [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
  - Travel
- :seedling: Iâ€™m currently deepening my knowledge of python, terraform, kubernetes, etc.  
- :book: Iâ€™m currently reading a few different books on k8s, python, etc.  
  TODO: add 'em.
- :snowman: Some projects I want to do/ am doing:
  - Homelab kubernetes cluster with a few Raspberry Pis provisioned and orchestrated with some or all of the following:
    - Ansible
    - [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/)
    - [Rancher](https://www.rancher.com/)
    - ???
  - [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) based static markdown file based blog on various geeky and personal topics served by the 
    [Digital Ocean App Platform](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/).  
    See [Current POC placeholder at runthing.com](https://runthing.com/)
  - Bring [GrandPrix.run](https://grandprix.run/) back from the :skull_and_crossbones: and get a [POC working](https://github.com/mreeves1/grandprix.run) 
    to rebuld my fullstack web dev ðŸ’ª
  - Create a few IAC repos to practice my terraform and [Cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) and possibly learn [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) and [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html)
    and have a bit of proof I know what I am doing.  
    In particular I want to easily bring up a vpc + eks cluster with managed nodes to play around with in AWS.
  - Create TF to create and manage a kubernetes cluster in Digital Ocean and migrate a few tiny projects to k8s vs. VMs there.
- :bulb: My brilliant startup idea is a running (and perhaps later cycling) club website.  
  I have been in running clubs for many years and their websites are always cobbled together with wix, squarespace, meetup, instagram, 
  facebook groups, mailing lists, paypal, venmo, spit, baling wire, duct tape, etc.  
  I'd like it to have the following features:
  - Membership and dues management
  - Event management
  - Merge my grandprix.run POC above
  - Possibly a way to find running partners, etc. within a club
  - Mailing list and Socials management (e.g. add an event and send an emal, insta post, facebook group post, etc.)
  - Possibly a way to share and display photos
  - A rudmentary forum?
  - A way to share good commercial resources like doctors, running stores, physical therapists, etc? 
- :mailbox: How to reach me
  - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/runamok/)
  - mike.reeves @ "the google email provider"
  - My INCREDIBLY stale personal website at [runamok.net](http://runamok.net/). Pretty sure the contact form is :skull_and_crossbones: though.
